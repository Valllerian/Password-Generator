## Installation
Current project has been saved in my personal GitHub repository and is currently available for cloning and reviews on:

https://valllerian.github.io/Password-Generator/

## Usage

Main page includes the cliclable button "Generate password" that invokes a prompt:

<br>
<img alt="Main Page screenchot" src="Images/Image1.jpg" />
<br>

First you`re being asked for the length of the password:

<br>
<img alt="length selection prompt" src="Images/Image2.jpg" />
<br>


If you in put a number that is not 8-128 you will recieve an alert:

<br>
<img alt="invalid length alert" src="Images/Image3.jpg" />
<br>

After a valid number for the character length you select types of characters for the password:

<br>
<img alt="types of characters selection" src="Images/Image4.jpg" />
<br>

You can`t skip all the character selection prompts, if so you would recieve an alert:


<br>
<img alt="an alert for canceling all the character type prompts" src="Images/Image5.jpg" />
<br>

If at least one of the options is selected the password will be generated:

<br>
<img alt="Generated password on the page" src="Images/Image6.jpg" />
<br>
